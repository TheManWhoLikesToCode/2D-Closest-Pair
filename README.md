## Description

This Java project, developed for CS 203, solves the 2D Closest Pair problem by finding the pair of points with the minimum distance between them in a 2D plane. The program prompts the user for the number of random points to generate. It implements two algorithms: a divide and conquer approach for efficiency, and a brute force method for comparison. The closest pairs and their distances are displayed for both algorithms. Additionally, if fewer than 15 points are generated, it also outputs the coordinates of each point.
